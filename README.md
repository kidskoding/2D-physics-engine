2d-physics-engine

A 2D physics engine written in C++ that simulates realistic motion, collisions, and rigid body dynamics in a 2D space.

The engine uses basic principles of Newtonian mechanics, including velocity, acceleration, and force application. 
It's designed for use in game development, simulations, and educational applications.
